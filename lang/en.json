This method is ideal for new players or those wanting a consistent, balanced setup across the party, ensuring each character begins on the same power level. Remember, your racial bonuses will still influence your final ability scores. Consider your class and racial bonuses carefully as you place these scores to optimize your characterâ€™s performance in their primary role."

By default, this uses the classic 4d6 drop the lowest method, but your DM may specify a custom rolling formula. While the results of this method can range from strong to average or even low scores, it adds an element of unpredictability to character building that can yield distinct strengths and weaknesses. This method is perfect for creating varied characters in short campaigns or one-shots, where surprising stats can inspire creative roleplaying. Embrace the randomness and enjoy the unique outcomes!"
