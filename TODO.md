# TODO

- FIX: Selecting custom compendiums and then deleting them should fall back to default 'SRD' and/or scanning for all
  compendiums.

- FIX: Choosing new custom compendiums should not throw error on missing compendiums, should be a warning and/or
  suppress based on log level.

- ADD: Roll 'all'/ Roll 'sequential' option/button to allow rolling stats faster.
